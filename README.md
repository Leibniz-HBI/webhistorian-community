# Web Historian - Community Edition

This is a research data collection tool created by 	[Ericka Menchen-Trevino](http://ericka.cc/). 

If you are interested in using Web Historian for your own research you will need to:
* Set up a server running [PassiveDataKit-Django](https://github.com/audaciouscode/PassiveDataKit-Django).
* (Optional) Create categories of websites relevant to your research in a json file.
* Customize Web Historian to describe your research (index.html)
* Create the js/app/config.js file based on the provided /js/app/config.js-template.js
  * This is where the links to the server and the study's survey go
